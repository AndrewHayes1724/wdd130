            within the game of rocket league. There are 1000's of decals, an RGB color palette, 1000's of wheels and
            other decorations for your car which make the design possibilities endless. Ever wonder how to sort all the
            decals from rarest to least rare? On our site we will show you exactly how to do it so that you can find the
            coolest decals for your car.
            The type of things you will learn and questions you will have answered on this site are first, where to
            start with designing your car. Then after that, what is possible rather than just simple car designs, you

        <h4>Getting Set Up</h4>
        <p>
            * The information that is necessary to do this will be to have rocket league installed on your computer, and
            then second to install something called "BakkusMod". This allows the person to have fully creativity in
            designing their car ingame. This is important, in order to create the car you want, you'll have to have the
            game open so that you can edit and change your car according to how you want it to look.
