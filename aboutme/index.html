    <h2>Andrew Hayes</h2>
    <p> So my name is Andrew as you can see above, I am currently a student in the Computer Science program here at
        BYUI. I want to take that degree and go towards big data analysis with machine learning and a lot of data
        science elements mixed in. I am married to my amazing wife Madison, we just got married last October. I am
        currently working as a developer for a software company where I deal with backend logical processes as well as a
        little bit of front end user interface stuff sprinkled in when they need an extra hand doing things. I feel that
        a huge advantage for me personally in going into a field as vast as computer science and web development is the
        amount of possible career paths and types of jobs. I love that I can pick a job and career that suits my
        interests.</p>
